 Good point. We'd want to ensure that there's a way to track when a transaction is pending confirmation from the receiver. This state of "awaiting confirmation" would be important to record so that subsequent actions can be triggered, such as updating the credits for the lender/giver once the transaction is confirmed. Here's how you could adjust the tables to accommodate this:
Revised Fields for transactions Table:

    confirmation_status: Add a new field that tracks whether the transaction is awaiting confirmation from the receiver. You could have statuses like "Pending", "Confirmed", and "Denied".

    confirmation_timestamp: A timestamp indicating when the transaction was confirmed by the receiver. This would allow you to audit when exactly the confirmation took place.

Revised SQL for transactions Table:

sql

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(id),
    lender_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    receiver_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    transaction_type VARCHAR(10) CHECK (transaction_type IN ('Lend', 'Gift')),
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('In Process', 'Completed', 'Cancelled')),
    confirmation_status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (confirmation_status IN ('Pending', 'Confirmed', 'Denied')),
    confirmation_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    credits_accrued INT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Logic to Update Fields

Once the receiver confirms the transaction, the following updates should occur:

    The confirmation_status in the transactions table should be updated to "Confirmed".
    The confirmation_timestamp should capture the current timestamp.
    The credits table should be updated to give the appropriate credits to the lender/giver.

By adding these fields and updating them accordingly, you can handle the scenario you described efficiently. Does this modification look sufficient to you?
